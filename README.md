# Machine-Learning-for-Real-Estate
The processing flow of traditional real estate project is as follows (Simplified): the regional branch will collect all information and data of the project, summarize them into ppt and report it to the board of directors, and then the board of directors will decide whether to invest based on these data. This is very time-consuming and laborious. Here we try to use machine learning to help people judge whether these projects should be invested.
The data of each project may include: project name, city, gross profit rate, net profit rate, sales cycle, etc.
And there will be a judgement of each project: Agree,Pass,Deny.What we are gonna do is to predict the judgement of the project based on the attributes of the project.
